Most functionality is implemented. API has had no issues like I ran into previously.

ToDo:

Team detail page needs work

Healer/tank/dps img do not show up. 


Possible adds if I have time:

Gear in profile page. Finally found that functionality in the API.

Show the utility of character, added up on the team page. This would be a very large undertaking, since it would have to be hardcoded per class and specialization.
