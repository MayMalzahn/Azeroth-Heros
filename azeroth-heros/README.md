Most functionality is implemented. API has had no issues like I ran into previously.

ToDo:

Adding to team is currently not functional. Trying to find work around for the function. Doesn't like using 'this' in a function called after render.

Nearly unstyled

Using props in a link is not working. Looking into workaround. Due to this, most img do not work. Links on profile page also do not work since they rely on the props to get exact page.

On profile page talents show up as objects, not their img

Home page needs more text. Originally, adding characters was done here. I now want it to have game information.


Possible adds if I have time:

Gear in profile page. Finally found that functionality in the API.

Show the utility of character, added up on the team page. This would be a very large undertaking, since it would have to be hardcoded per class and specialization.
